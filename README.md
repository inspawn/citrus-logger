## Welcome to pomelo-citrus-logger

pomelo-citrus-logger is a simple clone of pomelo-logger written in Ruby using EventMachine.

## Motivation

Since NodeJS is influenced by Ruby EventMachine and Python's Twisted model, Ruby should also be able to have its own game server framework like pomelo.

Ruby is a very expressive and eloquent programming language. I was an RoR programmer before and I really like Ruby, When developing this project, I have used many skills like meta-programming and they give me the real pleasures.

Recently, I would focus on my daily work, so I open source this project and hope to have more people participate in this project.

## Todo

This gem is empty now and it roles as a stub, this gem should function as a logger wrapper of log4r for pomelo logger system.
